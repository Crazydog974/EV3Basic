1        0  NXT-TOUCH       ReadPercent        0=not pressed,  100=pressed  

4        0  NXT-COL-REF     ReadPercent        0=no reflective light, 100=maximum reflective light
4        1  NXT-COL-AMB     ReadPercent        0=no ambient light, 100=maximum ambient light
4        2  NXT-COL-COL     ReadRaw (1 value)  1=black, 2=blue, 3=green, 4=yellow, 5=red, 6=white

5        0  NXT-US-CM       ReadRaw (1 value)  distance in cm

16       0  TOUCH           ReadPercent        0=not pressed,  100=pressed  

29       0  COL-REFLECT     ReadPercent        0=no reflected light, 100=maximum reflected light
29       1  COL-AMBIENT     ReadPercent        0=no ambient light, 100=maximum ambient light
29       2  COL-COLOR       ReadRaw (1 value)  0=unknown, 1=black, 2=blue, 3=green, 4=yellow, 5=red, 6=white, 7=brown
29       4  RGB-RAW         ReadRaw (3 values) value1=red intensity, value2=green intensity, value3=blue intensity

30       0  US-DIST-CM      ReadRaw (1 value)  distance in mm
30       1  US-DIST-IN      ReadRaw (1 value)  distance in tenth of an inch

32       0  GYRO-ANG        ReadRaw (1 value)  angle in degrees
32       1  GYRO-RATE       ReadRaw (1 value)  rate of change of angle in deg/s

33       0  IR-PROX         ReadPercent        distance in cm (not very accurate)
33       1  IR-SEEK         ReadRaw (2 values) value1=direction and value2=distance to IR beacon
33       2  IR-REMOTE       ReadRaw (4 values) value1=signal from channel 1 (*), value2=signal from channel 2...
                                    a remote control sender can be switched to use one of 4 channels 
                                    (slider on top position is channel 1) and the remote receiver can detect 
                                    all channel signals at the same time
                                               											       
(*) numbers for the remote control buttons (A=left top, B=left bottom, C=right top, D=right bottom, E=beacon activated):
	A = 1    A&B = 10   B&C = 7
	B = 2    A&C = 5    B&D = 8
	C = 3    A&D = 6    C&D = 11
	D = 4               E = 9
   other combinations give a reading of 0
