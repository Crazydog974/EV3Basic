<H1>I2C Tutorial</H1>
<H2>Why accessing I2C directly?</H1>
<P>
Normally interfacing to sensors from the EV3 brick is done using the easy-to-use Sensor.Read... commands. 
But some third-party devices are not compatible with the default sensor protocol and require extra programming. 
The vendors of such devices normally provide some programming blocks for the original graphics programming 
environment that handle all the details of the communication. 
</P>
<P>
For EV3Basic there is probably no such support available, but normally there is some documentation specifying 
the low-level communication protocol. Having this information, the Sensor.CommunicateI2C can be used to implement
any such protocol.
</P>
<H2>Introduction to I2C</H1>
<P>
I2C is a communication facility that allows a single master to access multiple slaves on a common bus
for reading and writing data. In the case of the EV3 each sensor port with its attached sensor device(s)
can form such a bus. 
</P>
<P>
The communication is done by the master sending a bunch of data bytes to a slave or by requesting
a bunch of data bytes. The slaves themselves can not initiate any data transfer. Because there can be multiple 
slaves connected to the bus, the master needs to make clear to which slave it wants to talk. This is done by 
sending a slave address (a number from 0 to 127) before communication. The designer of the system must 
make sure that no two slaves on a bus have the same address to avoid conflict.
</P>
<P>
The I2C protocol itself does only provide a means for communication, the meaning of the data is
totally depending on the devices in question. 
</P>
<H2>CommunicateI2C</H1>
<P>
This command of EV3Basic is the only way to access the I2C functionality directly in a raw form.
It combines the operation of sending an arbitrary number of bytes and receiving some bytes back. 
Example:
<pre>
W[0]=60
W[1]=70
W[2]=80
R=Sensor.CommunicateI2C(1,44,3,4,W)
</pre>
This will first send the bytes 60,70,80 to the slave with address 44 that is connected to sensor port 1.
Then it will fetch 4 bytes from the same slave. The received bytes are stored in the array R.
<H2>I2C Registers</H2>
<p>
The concept of registers is basically not part of the I2C protocol, but this concept is used
so widely, that it is now a kind of standard way to do communication with many devices.
On devices that use registers, all data transfer is done by the master writing 
into the slaves registers or reading data from the registers. A register is basically just 
a storage location that can hold one byte of data and is accessed via its register number
(or register 'address' - but using this name will probably lead to confusion because the slaves
themselves already have an I2C-address).
</p>
<p>
For the sake of simplicity, imagine a device that has 256 registers, with register numbers from 0 to 255 
that can be written to or read from (in fact you can buy a single chip that does exactly that - 
it is a 256 byte I2C RAM). The master can write into these registers by sending a data packet that 
contains the register number in the first byte and the content that should be written there and 
into the following registers in the subsequent bytes.
</p>
<P>
Reading data from registers is done in two steps. First a data packet containing just the 
register number is sent to the slave (like a normal write operation with zero data bytes). Then the 
required number of bytes are requested from the slave (which will have memorized the previously 
sent register number).
</p>
<p>
Example:  Receive registers 4 - 8 from the slave with address 55 on port 2.
<pre>
W[0] = 4
R = Sensor.CommunicateI2C (2, 55, 1, 5, W)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Example: Write into register 99 and 100 of the slave with address 97 on port 1.
In this case, one byte is unnecessarily received back from the slave because due to a bug/strange behaviour 
of the EV3 firmware is not possible to have a write operation without a read.
<pre>
W[0] = 99
W[1] = 8
W[2] = 8
R = Sensor.CommunicateI2C (1, 97, 3, 1, W)
</pre>
</p>

<H2>Sources of confusion</H2>
<P>
<H3>Slave address vs. Register address.</H3>
Many device documents refer to the slave address and the register number both just as 'address'. 
Make sure to understand the difference and what the documentation really means in each case.
<H3>Slave address is pre-multiplied by 2</H3>
The inner working of the protocol combines the 7 bits of the slave address (values from 0 to 127) with
a single bit that specifies the direction (read or write) to give 8 bit that need to be transmitted from master to slave.
Sometimes the developers of a device just write this combined value into the program to save a few processor cycles
during execution. When this value finds is way into the documentation, a slave address of for example 80 will 
be written 160 there. It is sometimes quite hard to figure out what the real address is. In doubt you need to 
write a test program to try if a slave address is valid.
